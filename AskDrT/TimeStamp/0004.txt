Why is my face and chest always so red? Is it from increased blood volume/perfusion from bodybuilding? I am red in those areas all the time, not just when working out. I am on doctor prescribed TRT, 200mg/wk of test cypionate taken subq in 2 weekly injections of 100mg ea. My girlfriend made the comment, "Why are all you guys in the gym on TRT always so red?????" I do not have high blood pressure, readings are consistantly in the 125/85 range. I phlebotomize about 3 times per year, and my hemoglobin/hematocrit are 16.2 and 47 respectively. I am 55 y/o, 5'8", 215 lbs. Been on TRT for 8 years, bodybuilding since my teens. I'm not on any other PED's. My supps are just fish oil, creatine and BCAA's. I don't use any preworkout or vasodilation stuff. I do take a baby aspirin every day.

Im 31 years old, training for about 8-9 years. Im 5foot7 and about 11% bf.
I plan on doing my first lean bulk cycle of Test prop 400mg week 1-10 and Turinabol at 30-40mg week 1-4 or 1-6. 
Ill also be running Finasteride at 1mg per day along with Nizoral shampoo eod and minoxidil twice per day. With a 4 week pct consisting nolvadex alone.
The reason I picked this cycle and dosage is because its the most Hair friendly cycle I could think of (I cant get anavar). 
Im not losing hair but it has slightly thinned in my mid 20s, my father is bald, and also 1 of my 3 brothers. 
I have about a Norwood 1-2 and this hasnt changed over the years with just using minoxidil/nizoral (no finasteride)
Here are my questions:
1. Do you think with the compounds Ive chosen/dosages are ok in regards to minimizing hair loss? Or is there anything you would change?
2. What protocol do you recommend with finasteride? Some people say not to run it in pct. Others say to run it 2 weeks into pct.
3. Do you recommend running Tudca and NAC as liver support with Turinabol?

Do you think after 6-8 weeks the Steroid loses its affect and no longer responds for growth?
